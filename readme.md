# Stregsystemet-CLI

This repository is the Stregsystemet CLI, to buy things in Stregsystemet, at AAU.
Use of this cli-tool is **at your own risk** and there will be no support guarranteed. Either try to resolve the issue yourself and submit a PR or write an issue.
 
## Requirements

The CLI is a python script that relies on no external dependendencies except `requests` and `urllib3`. The script is tested with python 3.9

## Installation

To install the script, simply `cURL` or `wget` it from GitHub

```bash
### For quick setup ON LINUX
wget -O "$HOME/.local/bin/sts" https://raw.githubusercontent.com/f-klubben/stregsystemet-cli/master/main.py # To download the script
chmod u+rwx "$HOME/.local/bin/sts" # For permission
sts -s # For setup

### For general purpose
wget -O sts https://raw.githubusercontent.com/f-klubben/stregsystemet-cli/master/main.py
```

Using the CLI in Powershell can be made easier by running the setup script, you can wget it.

```bash
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/f-klubben/stregsystemet-cli/master/setup.ps1
```

Installing it as a package in nix.

```nix
environment.systemPackages = [
	(import (fetchTarball "https://github.com/f-klubben/stregsystemet-cli/archive/master.tar.gz") {})
]
```

## Usage

```bash
$ sts -h
usage: sts [-h] [-u [USER]] [-i [ITEM]] [-c [COUNT]] [-b] [-l] [-p MONEY] [-a] [-o] [-s] [product]

positional arguments:
  product               Specifies the product to buy

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -u [USER], --user [USER]
                        Specifies your Stregsystem username
  -i [ITEM], --item [ITEM]
                        Specifies the item you wish to buy
  -c [COUNT], --count [COUNT]
                        Specifies the amount of items you wish to buy
  -b, --balance         Output only stregdollar balance
  -l, --history         Shows your recent purchases
  -p MONEY, --mobilepay MONEY
                        Provides a QR code to insert money into your account
  -a, --update          Update the script and then exists
  -o, --shorthands      Shows shorthands
  -s, --setup           Creates a .sts at /home/<user> storing your account username
```

The script also keeps track of your balance and what items are available in Stregsystemet.
